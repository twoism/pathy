    }
]

puts @obj.at_json_path("number")

=> [1,2,3]
@obj.at_json_path('hash.one')
=> {'two' => 2}
```

  @obj.should have_json_path "hash.one"
end
```


##Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
